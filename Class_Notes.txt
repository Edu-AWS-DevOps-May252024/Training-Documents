		Using AGILE Methodologies :
		
			We can able to achieve :
			
				- Continous Development 
				- Continous Integration 
				- Continous Testing 
				- Continous Delivery
					- It expects Manual Approvals for production release
					- Might leads to downtime.
			
			We cannot achieve :
			
				- Continous Deployment
					- It Doesn't expect any Manual Approvals for production release.
					- Production Release can be fully automated without any manual intervension
					- Zero Downtime.
					
					
	DevOps :::
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy/Process which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continous Development, Continous Integration, Continous Testing, Continous Delivery, Continous Deployment and Continous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
	How to Implement DevOps ?
	
		Teams involved in SDLC Process :
		
			- DevOps Team :
				- Infra-Structure Management Team   20 Test Servers -->
				- Application Development Team 		
				- Testing Team 
				- Release Management Team
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- Security Administration Team 
				
			
		DevOps Stages :	

			- Continous Development :
			
				- It is a capability of the Development Team to Continously develop the Applications and improve the productivity of the Developers.
				
					Role of Developer :
					
						- Create Source Codes  
						- Build the Code - Compile and create artifacts(Binaries - *.exec/*.dll/*.war/*.jar)
						- Unit Testing 
						- Promote the Changes to Test Environments for further Testing
						- Notify the Testing Teams thru Email 
						
					On DevOps Perspective - Using DevOps Process ::
					
						- Create the Source Code
						- Save/Commit the Source Code Changes to a Source Code Repository(GITHUB/GITLAB/AWS CodeCommit/Az Repo)
						
						Thru DevOps Tools Automate: 
						
						- Build the Code - Compile and create artifacts(Binaries - *.exec/*.dll/*.war/*.jar)
						- Unit Testing 
						- Promote the Changes to Test Environments for further Testing
						- Notify the Testing Teams thru Email 

					Tools :
						
						IDEs - Integrated Development Environments 
						- Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Pycharm
						
						- Build Tools - Maven/Gradle, .Net SDK, Python
						
						- Unit Testing Tools - Junit, TestNG - 20 Test Cases 
			
			- Continous Integration :
				- It is a capability of the Development Team to Continously Integrate their code changes for further testing without impacting others' changes.

						Thru DevOps Tools Automate: 
						
						- Save/Commit the Source Code Changes to a Source Code Repository(GITHUB/GITLAB/AWS CodeCommit/Az Repo)						
						- Build the Code - Compile and create artifacts(Binaries - *.exec/*.dll/*.war/*.jar)
						- Unit Testing 
						- Promote the Changes to Test Environments for further Testing
						- Notify the Testing Teams thru Email 
						
				- Tools :
				
					IDEs, Jenkins, AWS Code Pipeline, AWS CodeBuild, Docker, Kubernetes
						
			- Continous Testing :
				- It is used to test and validate the code changes, Thru devops, we can integrate the testing tools and automate the end-to-end testing.
				
				Tools : Junit/TestNG/Selenium - Jenkins, AWS Pipeline
			
			- Continous Delivery / Deployment :
			
				- Both Continous Delivery/Deployment are used for Production Releases.
	
				- Continous Delivery :
					- It expects Manual Approvals for production release
					- Might leads to downtime.

				Eg.: 
				
					Financial / Banking Domain - Core Business 
					
					Online Banking :::
						Down the service - Production Release Window (Off-Business/Usage)
						4 - 6 Hrs. 
						Production Level Testing
						- Fix the issue 
						- Revert the changes under worst case

					
				- Continous Deployment :
					- It Doesn't expect any Manual Approvals for production release.
					- Production Release can be fully automated without any manual intervension
					- Zero Downtime.	

				- To Achieve Continous Deloyment the Application Architecture plays an important role.
				
					- Monolith Application Architecture
						- It is a tightly coupled Application
						- All the dependencies/functions are tightly coupled together
					
					- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
						- Loosely Coupled Applications
						- All the dependencies/functions are considered as individual Micro-Service, which can be independently developed, build, testing and released to production.
						
				Continous Deployment can be achieved only using Micro-Service based Application Architecture
				
				Eg.: 
				
					Facebook/Netflix/amazon.com 
					
					Matured Level of DevOps using a complete Shift-Left Approach 
			
			
				CI/CD Pipeline --> AWS Pipeline / Jenkins / gitlab-ci / Az Pipelines
			
			- Continous Monitoring :
			
				- This is to monitor the Infra-Structure and Applications running in Production Environments.
				
				Tools :
							www.awazon.com --> 10000 users accessing the site 
					
					Production Support/Monitoring Team :
					
						Infra-Structure Monitoring
							- AWS Cloud watch 
							- Dynatrace / Prometheus / Grafana
							
						Applications Monitoring 
							- App-Dynamics 
							- Data-Dog
			
			- Infra-Structure Management Team :
			
				Provisioning/Creating the Servers 
					- AWS Cloudformation / Terraform 
				
				Configure the Servers 
					- AWS Cloudformation / Ansible / Chef / Puppet
					
		Environments :
		
			Non-Prod Environments													Production Environments 
			
				Dev Environment	(servers/VMs)
				Build Environment
				Test Environments
					QA 
					UAT									 =======>						Prod Environments

		Docker Containers & Container Images ????
		
		
	Containerization :::
		
		- It is a process of packaging the application along with its dependencies.
		
		
	Scenario 1 :
	
		Developers' Build/Deployment :	1 
		
			Eclipse IDE 		Dev Environment
			
				Create src code, version control it using git, integrate tomcat server and unit test my application in Local Machine.
				
					jdk17, tomcat8.5
					
					jdk11, tomcat9
					
					Openjdk11, tomcat10
				
					Build - Artifact  								mywebapp.war 
					
					
					create code
					
					build  --			 mywebapp.war_v1.0 
					
					
						Package (mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk17, tomcat8.5)		---> mywebapp_img:v1.0

						Package (mywebapp.war_v1.0,jdk11, tomcat7)			---> mywebapp_img:v2.0

						Package (mywebapp.war_v1.0,Openjdk17, tomcat9)		---> mywebapp_img:v3.0
						
						ECS :
						
						This Image will be stored/Version Controlled in the Container Registry(ECR,DockerHub)
				
				Promote the changes to target environment 
				
				QA Environment 		--> jdk8, tomcat7 -->	jdk, tomcat	 ---> 	mywebapp.war  - jdk17, tomcat8.5
				
									mywebapp_img:v1.0			
				
				Monolith --> 
				
							-- Compatibility issue. 
							
							
			Working with Containerization :::
			
				Terminologies :::
				
					Image 					: 	A Static File that defines the application and its dependencies
												It is Non-Executable 
												It composed of various layers / Instructions
								
					Container 				:	Executable of Container Images
					
					Container Engine 		:	Used to Create/Manage the Container Images and Containers 
												Docker Engine 
										
					Container Registry 		:	Is to manage/version control the Container Images 
												Dockerhub / ECR 
											
					Container Repository	:	Subset of Container Registry
					
					
		
	Scenario 2 :
	
		Infra-Structure Perspective :
		
			Containerization :::
				- Is used to reduce the no. of VMs 
		
		Build Server :::	Code Build 
		
				VM - Build Server 
					Install Container Engine 
					
						- Container1 - jdk
						- Container2 - .net
		
			50 Types of Applications to be built
			
				jdk
				.net 
				python
				angular
				nodejs 
		
		Deployment Server :::	Code Deploy
		
				jdk
				.net 
				python
				angular
				nodejs 		
				

		DevOps Team 
		
		CI-CD 
			Container & Kubernetes Tools 
		
		Infra-Structure		
			Terraform 


		Virtual Machine :::
			- VMs are Hardware level Virtualization 
			- VMs are used to run the Operating System
			- It consume more space and time to start the Application
			- VM will be consuming the resources, even if there is not task/application running 
		
		Container :::
		
			- Containers are OS level Virtualization
			- It is used to run the Application/Task. NOT to run Operating System
			- Once the Application/Task is completed it will immediately go to exit state and release all the resources
			
		
		
		How to Create/Build Container Images :::
		
			Input : *.war ==> Artifacts - s3 Bucket 
			
			Image Build : 
			
				Dockerfile / ImageBuildfile :::
					- Composed of various instructions to build the layers of Image.
					- will be part of the sourcecode repository
					
					ECS :::
					
					Instruction to build the Image:
					
					FROM 		# Used to Identify the base Image 
					
					COPY 		# Copy the files/artifacts from the host volume to container volume

					CP 			# Copy the files/folders within the container volume
					
					ADD			# Copy the files/artifacts from the host volume to container volume
								# Copy the files/folders from Internet to container volume 
								
					WORKDIR		# used identify the current working dir
					
					EXPOSE 		# to expose the container port
					
					ENV 		# Used to have Environmental variable 
					
					RUN			# Run/Execute the package managers like yum/apt/dnf
					
					CMD			# Set the start-up/task command to the container
								# It can be change at run-time 
					
					ENTRYPOINT	# Set the start-up/task command to the container
								# It cannot be changed at run-time 
					
					
					
					image_name:v1
					
					
					
					ENTRYPOINT echo "Hello"
