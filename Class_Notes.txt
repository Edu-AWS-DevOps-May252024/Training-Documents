	What is DevOps ???
	
		- CI/CD 
		
	Why we need DevOps ?
	
	Benefits ?
	
	Why to used DevOps on Cloud ?
	
	
	Software Development Lifecycle :::
	
	Software Application :::
	
		Desktop Applications
		Web Applications
		Mobile Applications
		System Applications 
		Embedded Applications 

			Web Applications --> Online Training portal
			Desktop Applications --> Billing System - Supermarket 
						Requirement 
							- Functions - 
							= User Interface Design
							- Inventory Management
							- Billing 
							- Payment
							- Delivery

	- Requirement Analysis 
	- Design/Documentation
	- Coding/Development 
	- Testing 
	- Implementation 
	- Monitoring/Maintain
	
	Waterfall Model :
		- It is linear in fashion 
		- Strictly follows the Top-Down Approach
		- Monolith Applications were developed using this Model
		

			Desktop Applications --> Billing System - Supermarket 	==> 12 Months 
						Requirement 
							- Functions 
							- User Interface Design
							- Inventory Management
							- Billing 
							- Payment -> cash/card/upi
							- Delivery

	AGILE Methodologies ::: SDLC 

			Desktop Applications --> Billing System - Supermarket 	==> 12 Months 
						Requirement 
							- Functions/Module --> Iterations

		- Implementation for further release with manual approvals
		- Monitoring/Maintain

		Iteration 1 - User Interface Design		- Developer1

			- Testing 
			- Implementation for further release with manual approvals
			- Monitoring/Maintain			

		Iteration 2 - Inventory Management		- Developer2

			- Monitoring/Maintain
			
		Using AGILE Methodologies :
		
			We can able to achieve :
			
				- Continous Development 
				- Continous Integration 
				- Continous Testing 
				- Continous Delivery
					- It expects Manual Approvals for production release
					- Might leads to downtime.
			
			We cannot achieve :
			
				- Continous Deployment
					- It Doesn't expect any Manual Approvals for production release.
					- Production Release can be fully automated without any manual intervension
					- Zero Downtime.
					
					
	DevOps :::
	
		DevOps is a Software Development Strategy/Process which helps to promote the collaboration between the teams like Development Team and Operations Team to achieve Continous Development, Continous Integration, Continous Testing, Continous Delivery, Continous Deployment and Continous Monitoring in more automated fashion.
		
	How to Implement DevOps ?
	
		Teams involved in SDLC Process :
		
			- DevOps Team :
				- Infra-Structure Management Team   20 Test Servers -->
				- Application Development Team 		
				- Testing Team 
				- Release Management Team
				- Production Support Team 
				- Production Monitoring Team 
				- Security Administration Team 
				
			
		DevOps Stages :	

			- Continous Development :
			
				- It is a capability of the Development Team to Continously develop the Applications and improve the productivity of the Developers.
				
					Role of Developer :
					
						- Create Source Codes  
						- Build the Code - Compile and create artifacts(Binaries - *.exec/*.dll/*.war/*.jar)
						- Unit Testing 
						- Promote the Changes to Test Environments for further Testing
						- Notify the Testing Teams thru Email 
						
					On DevOps Perspective - Using DevOps Process ::
					
						- Create the Source Code
						- Save/Commit the Source Code Changes to a Source Code Repository(GITHUB/GITLAB/AWS CodeCommit/Az Repo)
						
						Thru DevOps Tools Automate: 
						
						- Build the Code - Compile and create artifacts(Binaries - *.exec/*.dll/*.war/*.jar)
						- Unit Testing 
						- Promote the Changes to Test Environments for further Testing
						- Notify the Testing Teams thru Email 

					Tools :
						
						IDEs - Integrated Development Environments 
						- Eclipse based IDEs, Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Pycharm
						
						- Build Tools - Maven/Gradle, .Net SDK, Python
						
						- Unit Testing Tools - Junit, TestNG - 20 Test Cases 
			
			- Continous Integration :
				- It is a capability of the Development Team to Continously Integrate their code changes for further testing without impacting others' changes.

						Thru DevOps Tools Automate: 
						
						- Save/Commit the Source Code Changes to a Source Code Repository(GITHUB/GITLAB/AWS CodeCommit/Az Repo)						
						- Build the Code - Compile and create artifacts(Binaries - *.exec/*.dll/*.war/*.jar)
						- Unit Testing 
						- Promote the Changes to Test Environments for further Testing
						- Notify the Testing Teams thru Email 
						
				- Tools :
				
					IDEs, Jenkins, AWS Code Pipeline, AWS CodeBuild, Docker, Kubernetes
						
			- Continous Testing :
				- It is used to test and validate the code changes, Thru devops, we can integrate the testing tools and automate the end-to-end testing.
				
				Tools : Junit/TestNG/Selenium - Jenkins, AWS Pipeline
			
			- Continous Delivery / Deployment :
			
				- Both Continous Delivery/Deployment are used for Production Releases.
	
				- Continous Delivery :
					- It expects Manual Approvals for production release
					- Might leads to downtime.

				Eg.: 
				
					Financial / Banking Domain - Core Business 
					
					Online Banking :::
						Down the service - Production Release Window (Off-Business/Usage)
						4 - 6 Hrs. 
						Production Level Testing
						- Fix the issue 
						- Revert the changes under worst case

					
				- Continous Deployment :
					- It Doesn't expect any Manual Approvals for production release.
					- Production Release can be fully automated without any manual intervension
					- Zero Downtime.	

				- To Achieve Continous Deloyment the Application Architecture plays an important role.
				
					- Monolith Application Architecture
						- It is a tightly coupled Application
						- All the dependencies/functions are tightly coupled together
					
					- Micro-Service Based Application Architecture
						- Loosely Coupled Applications
						- All the dependencies/functions are considered as individual Micro-Service, which can be independently developed, build, testing and released to production.
						
				Continous Deployment can be achieved only using Micro-Service based Application Architecture
				
				Eg.: 
				
					Facebook/Netflix/amazon.com 
					
					Matured Level of DevOps using a complete Shift-Left Approach 
			
			
				CI/CD Pipeline --> AWS Pipeline / Jenkins / gitlab-ci / Az Pipelines
			
			- Continous Monitoring :
			
				- This is to monitor the Infra-Structure and Applications running in Production Environments.
				
				Tools :
							www.awazon.com --> 10000 users accessing the site 
					
					Production Support/Monitoring Team :
					
						Infra-Structure Monitoring
							- AWS Cloud watch 
							- Dynatrace / Prometheus / Grafana
							
						Applications Monitoring 
							- App-Dynamics 
							- Data-Dog
			
			- Infra-Structure Management Team :
			
				Provisioning/Creating the Servers 
					- AWS Cloudformation / Terraform 
				
				Configure the Servers 
					- AWS Cloudformation / Ansible / Chef / Puppet
					
		Environments :
		
			Non-Prod Environments													Production Environments 
			
				Dev Environment	(servers/VMs)
				Build Environment
				Test Environments
					QA 
					UAT									 =======>						Prod Environments
